  ##DESCRIPTION
  Balancing a lot of projects, I wanted to make one easier way to generate README files for my projects as I make them, in the command line. A quality read me is crucial for development, and I wanted to make sure I always remembered to include the important components of a README file.

  ##INSTALLATION
  First clone the starter code from GitHub. Next, download and npm packages you need to run the application. Then, run the index.js file in the command line. You will be prompted to enter information about your project, and your README will be conveniently generated!

  ##USAGE INFO
  Make sure to make it your own! Include any other information or omit any that you think would make your README stand out!
